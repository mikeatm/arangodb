Contributing
============

We welcome bug fixes and patches from 3rd party contributors. Please
see the [Contributor Agreement](https://www.arangodb.com/community#contribute)
for details.

Please follow these guidelines if you want to contribute to ArangoDB:

Getting started
---------------

* Please make sure you have a GitHub account

* Please look into the ArangoDB issue tracker on GitHub for similar/identical
  issues.

* For bugs: if the bug you found is not yet described in an existing
  issue, please file a new one. The new issue should include a clear
  description of the bug and how to reproduce it (including your
  environment).

* For feature requests: please clearly describe the proposed feature, additional
  configuration options, and side effects.

* Please let us know if you plan to work on a ticket. This way we can make sure
  we avoid redundant work.

* Create a fork of our repository. You can use GitHub to do this.

* Clone the fork to your development box and pull the latest changes from the
  ArangoDB repository. Please make sure to use the appropriate branch:

  * the **devel** branch is normally used for new features 

  * bug fixes should be done in the **devel** branch first, before being applied to
    master or other branches.

* If missing, install the required prerequisites. They are listed
  [in the manual](https://docs.arangodb.com/Installing/Compiling.html).

* configure and make your local clone. If you intend to modify the parser files,
  please make sure to activate the --enable-maintainer-mode configure option. In
  this case, you also need to have Python installed.

* Make sure the unmodified clone works locally before making any code
  changes. You can do so by running the included test suite (i.e. make
  unittests)

* If you intend to do documentation changes, you also must install Doxygen in
  the most recent version.

Making Changes
--------------

* Create a new branch in your fork

* Develop and test your modifications there

* Commit as you like, but preferrably in logical chunks. Use meaningful commit
  messages and make sure you do not commit unneccesary files (e.g. object
  files). It is normally a good idea to reference the issue number from the
  commit message so the issues will get updated automatically with comments.

* If the modifications change any documented behavior or add new features,
  document the changes. The documentation can be found in arangod/Documentation
  directory. To recreate the documentation locally, run make doxygen. This will
  re-create all documentation files in the Doxygen directory in your
  repository. You can inspect the documentation in this folder using a text
  editor or a browser. We recently agreed that future documentation should be
  written in American English (AE).

* When done, run the complete test suite and make sure all tests pass.

* When finished, push the changes to your GitHub repository and send a pull
  request from your fork to the ArangoDB repository. Please make sure to select
  the appropriate branches there. This will most likely be **devel**.

* You must use the Apache License for your changes.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

When reporting bugs, please use our issue tracker on GitHub.  Please make sure
to include the version number of ArangoDB in your bug report, along with the
platform you are using (e.g. `Linux OpenSuSE x86_64`).  Please also include the
ArangoDB startup mode (daemon, console, supervisor mode) plus any special
configuration.  This will help us reproducing and finding bugs.
